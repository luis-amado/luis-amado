## Who am I?
Hey! I'm Luis Amado, a second-year computer science student. I am passionate about Software Engineering and a lot of other cool stuff too! Feel free to take a look at my page to see more about me. 

## Experience
### **Google**, Sunnyvale, CA
STEP Intern
- Worked alongside another intern to refactor and improve a complex and outdated image metadata indexing pipeline using C++, resulting in a more maintanable codebase and increasing compliance with other systems.
- During the 12 weeks, I completed the whole development process. From writing a design doc and discussing implementations to going through code reviews, conducting quality evaluations, launching, and ramping up traffic to our new system.

## Achievements
- HackMTY 2023: Top 10 finalist in the largest hackathon in Latin America
- Academic Achievement Scholarship
